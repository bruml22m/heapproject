# Assignment Journal
> This is where you will keep your assignment journal; at specific points in
> the assignment, you will be advised to write an entry.  As described in the
> grading section of the assignment document, I have provided some prompts to
> get you started; you are not strictly bound to them.

## 1. At the very beginning
> In this space, you should write a bit about your understanding of the heap
> before really starting on the assignment.  Here are some example questions
> you may want to consider (but these are only meant as suggestions):
> What is the heap?  Why does it exist?  Do you know how it is managed, or
> can you make a guess?
> You might also wish to consider more self-centered questions, such asâ€¦
> how ready do you feel to tackle this assignment?



## 2. Getting started
> Now that you have read some of the background, some things may be
> clearer... or they may be even more confusing!  Has anything changed?
> Would you change any of your answers above?



## 3. Initializing the Heap
> In this space, describe your process of getting the first tests to pass.
> What problems did you run into?  What did you need to learn to resolve them?



## 4. Implementing malloc()
> In this space, describe your process of getting the related tests to pass.
> What problems did you run into?  What did you need to learn to resolve
> them?  Did you need to change anything you'd done before in terms of the
> code?  Did you find you had misunderstood something earlier which you feel
> like you understood now?  Do you have questions remaining?
> Note: I would expect this section may be shorter than the ones that follow.



## 5. Implementing free()
> Was this section easier or harder than the ones before?  What was the most
> difficult part (if any)?  After implementing free(), do you predict
> realloc() will be easier or harder?



## 6. Implementing realloc()
> Were you right with your prediction from the last stage?  Was there any
> aspect of realloc() which surprised you?



## 7. Finishing
> Look back at your answers from the first stage above.  What has changed
> since then?
> How do you feel about your knowledge of heap memory now?  How would you
> compare the heap with the stack and static memory?  (It's okay to admit the
> things that you don't know!)
